Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my GitHub! I'm all about creating cool stuff with AI, data, and a touch of creativity. You'll find projects here that mix tech and fun, like recommending Taylor Swift songs 🎶, building AI tools for movies 🎥, and even analyzing marketing campaigns 📊. I’ve also got 1.5+ years of experience as a Data Analyst at Clootrack, where I worked on market research and consumer analytics using text analytics and NLP. It’s been an exciting ride turning messy data into meaningful insights and helping brands understand their customers better. Feel free to explore, fork, or just drop a star ⭐ if you like what you see. Let’s build something awesome together! 😊
